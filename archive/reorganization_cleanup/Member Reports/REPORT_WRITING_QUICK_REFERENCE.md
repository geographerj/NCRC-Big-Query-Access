# Member Report Writing - Quick Reference

**⚡ CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR ALL MEMBER REPORTS ⚡**

## Format Standards
- **Percentages**: `##.#` format (12.5%, not 12.50%)
- **Integers**: `#,###` format (1,234, not 1234)
- **Gaps**: Percentage points with one decimal (-5.2pp, +3.1pp)

## Writing Rules
- ✅ **Plain English** for general audience
- ✅ **Minimal data citations** - tables show the data
- ✅ **Cite only key points**: largest gaps, biggest changes
- ✅ **Objective tone** - no emotional language
- ✅ **Define acronyms** on first use

## Required Sections (Every Report)
1. **Key Findings** - Scale, patterns, metric-specific analysis
2. **Recommendations** - Immediate action, reforms, regulatory considerations
3. **Methodology** - Data source, scope, testing, metrics, gap calculation
4. **How to Read the Data** - Table explanations, asterisks, values

## Language Guidelines

### Use ✅

### Avoid ❌

- "violations," "systemic" (unless legally established)

- Methods **reproducible**
- Include **caveats and limitations**
- Report **positive AND negative** findings
- **Neutral framing** throughout
