=== QUICK START GUIDE ===

The Cursor terminal has a bug and won't run Python. Use these steps:

1. OPEN BIGQUERY:
   Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery

2. RUN THE SQL:
   - Click "Compose new query"
   - Open FIFTH_THIRD_REDLINING_FULL_QUERY.sql in this folder
   - Copy the ENTIRE file (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
   - Paste into BigQuery query editor
   - Click "Run"

3. EXPORT RESULTS:
   - Once query completes, click "Save results"
   - Choose "CSV" format
   - Save as: fifth_third_results.csv

4. GENERATE EXCEL REPORT:
   - Open a regular PowerShell terminal (NOT in Cursor)
   - Navigate to this folder:
     cd "C:\Users\edite\OneDrive - Nat'l Community Reinvestment Coaltn\Desktop\DREAM Analysis"
   - Run:
     python ncrc_worst_lenders_analysis_v4.py fifth_third_results.csv

5. FIND YOUR REPORT:
   - Look for a new Excel file with today's date in the folder

Done!
