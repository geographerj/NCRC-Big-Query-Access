# Member Report Writing Guidelines

**CRITICAL: These guidelines MUST be followed for all member reports.**

## Core Principles

**Always use plain English for a general audience.**

- Format percentages as `##.#` (e.g., 12.5%, 3.2%)
- Format integers as `#,###` (e.g., 1,234, 45,678)

**Do not cite a lot of data in your narratives.** The tables include the data that the user can read. Only cite data points if they are a **key point of the discussion**. For example:
- The largest gap between black and white loans
- The largest change in low to moderate income borrowing year over year

**Always refer to the documents in your knowledge for context.**

## Writing Style Guidelines

### 1. Tone and Voice

- Maintain **objective, factual tone** throughout
- Avoid emotional language or advocacy rhetoric
- Use precise, quantitative descriptions
- Let data speak for itself without editorializing

### 2. Technical Precision

- **Define all acronyms on first use**: HMDA (Home Mortgage Disclosure Act), MMCT (Majority-Minority Census Tract), etc.
- Express all gaps as **percentage points with one decimal place** (e.g., -5.2pp, +3.1pp)
- Always specify whether values are **positive (overperformance)** or **negative (underperformance)**
- Include sample sizes where relevant

### 3. Conservative Claims

- Use phrases like **"demonstrates," "shows," or "indicates"** rather than "proves"
- Acknowledge patterns without attributing intent
- Note **"systematic" patterns** rather than "systemic" unless legally established
- Avoid speculation about causes or motivations

## Required Sections

### 1. Key Findings

- **Scale of Problems**: Total metros analyzed, number/percentage with problems
- **Geographic Pattern Analysis**: Regional or market-specific patterns
- **Metric-Specific Performance**: Analyze each metric separately
- **Comparison points** if applicable (year-over-year, peer comparisons, etc.)

### 2. Recommendations

- **Immediate Intervention Required** (for Tier 1 metros)
- **Systemic Reforms Needed**
- **Regulatory Considerations**
- Frame as **operational improvements** rather than punitive measures

### 3. Methodology Section

- **Data source**: HMDA with years
- **Scope**: Geographic boundaries (census tracts, counties, etc.)
- **Loan Filters**: Document all standard HMDA filters applied:
  - Loan Purpose: Home purchase loans only
  - Action Taken: Originations only
  - Occupancy Type: Owner-occupied
  - Reverse Mortgages: Excluded
  - Construction Method: Site-built only
  - Property Units: 1-4 family units
  - Loan Types: All types included (conventional, FHA, VA, USDA)
- **Statistical testing approach**
- **Metrics analyzed**: List all standard metrics with numbered definitions
- **Demographic data sources**: Census API, Community Profiles, or both
- **Historical trend analysis**: Reference to 2000, 2010, 2020, and current ACS data
- **Race/ethnicity classification**: NCRC methodology (Hispanic first, then race)
- **AI disclosure**: Note use of Cursor and AI models, with disclaimer

### 4. How to Read the Data

- Explanation of table columns
- Meaning of asterisks (*) for statistical significance
- Interpretation of negative vs. positive values
- Pattern classification definitions
- Brief, clear explanations for non-technical readers

## Legal Preparation Standards

### 1. Documentation Requirements

- Every claim must be **traceable to specific data**
- Methods must be **reproducible by opposing counsel**
- Avoid conclusory statements without supporting evidence
- Include all relevant **caveats and limitations**

### 2. Neutral Framing

- Present findings as **"disparities" or "gaps"** rather than "discrimination"
- Note **"underperformance"** rather than "exclusion"
- Describe patterns as **"requiring attention"** rather than "violations"

### 3. Completeness

- Include **all years of available data**
- Report both **positive and negative findings**
- Note any **improvements over time**
- Acknowledge **market context** where relevant

---

## Visual Consistency

### 1. Formatting Standards

- Use **consistent table formats** across all metros
- **Bold key terms** in findings sections
- Maintain **parallel structure** in lists
- Use **bullet points** for detailed breakdowns

### 2. Data Presentation

- Round percentages to **one decimal place** (X.X%)
- Use **em-dashes (—)** for missing data
- Keep numerical formats consistent (e.g., always X.X%)
- Align columns for easy scanning

---

## Format Specifications

### Numbers
- **Percentages**: `##.#` format → 12.5%, 3.2%, 0.8%
- **Integers**: `#,###` format → 1,234, 45,678, 123,456
- **Gaps**: Express as percentage points with one decimal → -5.2pp, +3.1pp

### Text Formatting
- **Bold** for key terms and important findings
- **Em-dashes (—)** for missing/unavailable data
- **Asterisks (*)** for statistically significant findings (define in methodology)

### Acronyms
- Always define on first use: "The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data shows..."
- Use acronym thereafter: "HMDA data from 2018-2024..."
